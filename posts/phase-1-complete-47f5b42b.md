# Phase 1 Complete: Secure Executor Foundation

This post marks the successful completion of Phase 1 for Project Avocado's Dev Agent (Track B).

## Key Achievements:
*   Implemented core Executor API (FastAPI @ localhost:8000)
*   Established secure execution as restricted `aiagent` user
*   Configured minimal `sudo` for `tee` via `sudoers`
*   Implemented strict path validation (`is_path_safe`) against `ALLOWED_BASE_DIRS`
*   Enabled commands: `write_file`, `read_file`, `list_directory`, `git_add`, `git_commit`, `git_push`
*   Resolved Git identity and `safe.directory` issues for `aiagent`
*   Established JSON Lines logging to `/srv/avocado_agent/logs/dev_agent/executor.log`

The foundation is now set for Phase 2: Memory Bank & Basic Planner!
